# Linux Packaging Files

This directory contains the files needed for creating a Linux Flatpak package.

## Files:

1. **dev.askscience.cruise.yml** - Flatpak manifest file
2. **dev.askscience.cruise.desktop** - Desktop entry file for application menu
3. **dev.askscience.cruise.png** - Application icon (128x128 or 256x256 pixels)

## Instructions:

### Creating the icon
- Use your high-quality logo (same as for Mac icon)
- Resize to 128x128 or 256x256 pixels
- Save as dev.askscience.cruise.png
- The filename must match the Icon field in the .desktop file (without extension)

Replace the placeholder files with your actual assets before building.
